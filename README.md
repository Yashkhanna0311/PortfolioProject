# PortfolioProject
This project is basically a data analysis project made by me. In this project i have have written some SQL queries to extract data from a excel file containing data on hotels and have calculated the total revenue by combining different tables 
The excel file contain two types of hotels with each having data of three years 2018,2019 and 2020. It also contained details of people about how many days they stayed and what type and cost of meal they had.
So i basically calculated revenue of of both types of hotel each year and told the client about the change in revenue per year.
